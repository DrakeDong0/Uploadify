### Uploadify

This is a spotify playlist import/export tool that can be used between spotify accounts.

Selected playlists are stored as a json file which can be sent, saved or uploaded to cloud storage sites. Playlist sizes range from a few kb to several mb. To reduce file size, upload playlists without a playlist image.  

## Installation

Uploadify is currently in development mode and is pending approval from spotify to be publicly available.
