# Uploadify

This is a spotify playlist import/export tool that can be used between spotify accounts.

Selected playlists are stored as a json file which can be sent, saved or uploaded to storage locations. Playlist sizes range from a few kb to several mb. To reduce file size, upload playlists without a playlist image.  

## Requirements

Uploadify unfortunately is not approved by spotify so it is not available publically. 

## Features
- **OAuth 2.0**: Uses Spotify's OAuth to authenticate users, which then generates a local token to be used for security.
- **Sidebar**: Search, add, delete, playlists within Uploadify to keep what you need.
